Hi — I’m **Moeen Mostafavi**, a computational social scientist and data scientist focused on
**NLP**, **machine learning**, and **decision support** at the intersection of
**social systems**, **finance**, and **safety/health**.

I earned my Ph.D. in **Systems & Information Engineering** at the University of Virginia,
where my dissertation, *Enhancing Emotion Understanding in Messaging Interactions*, integrated
transformer models with **Affect Control Theory** to model affective dynamics in digital
communication (see my paper in *Sociological Methodology*, 2024). I’ve also led and
collaborated on interdisciplinary projects spanning **political analytics**, **telematics-based
fleet safety**, **RFID + haptics** for collision prediction in contact sports, and
technology-enabled sleep tracking in older adults.

I currently work at the **Virginia Retirement System (VRS)**, applying ML and large-scale
data analysis to **mortgage-backed securities** and fixed-income research. Earlier work
received support from **Jefferson Trust** (fleet safety) and **ARO W911NF1710509** (emotion
modeling with contextual embeddings, coauthored), and I previously held grants/fellowships from
**INSF** and others.

I care deeply about inclusive, hands-on teaching. At UVA I supported courses in **Exploratory
Text Analytics**, **Statistical Modeling**, and **Business Analysis**; student and peer
recognition includes the **Robert T. Ferguson III Memorial Award**. I enjoy building short,
“just-in-time” primers, annotated notebooks, and flexible mentoring structures that help
students from diverse backgrounds succeed.

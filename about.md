Hi — I’m **Moeen Mostafavi**, a computational social scientist and systems engineer based in Richmond, VA. 
I build data-driven tools that connect modern AI with social and economic decision-making—spanning language and meaning in digital communication, safety and behavior analytics, and applied finance.

I earned my Ph.D. in **Systems & Information Engineering** at the University of Virginia, where my dissertation combined **transformer-based NLP** with **Affect Control Theory** to better measure emotion and meaning in messaging. Today, I apply similar methods to real-world problems in public safety and markets, and I enjoy collaborating across disciplines (sociology, economics, kinesiology, nursing, political science, data science, business, and engineering).

### What I work on
- **Language, emotion, and meaning.** Context-aware affect lexicons and modeling for conversational data (e.g., BERTNN + ACT).  
- **Behavioral analytics for safety & sustainability.** Telematics-driven insights and interventions (e.g., Mindful Driving).  
- **Sensing & human performance.** RFID and haptic feedback to anticipate collisions in contact sports.  
- **Risk & decision support in finance.** Model pipelines that integrate borrower, loan, and market signals for fixed-income decisions.

### A few highlights
- **Contextual embeddings for social science** → Published in *Sociological Methodology* (2024).  
  [Paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00811750241260729) · Related: [UMAP’21](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3450613.3459661) · [IEEE SysCon’21 (emoji/embeddings)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9447137)

- **Mindful Driving (telematics + ML)** → Recognized as NAFA *Best Special Project in North America* (2021).  
  PI on a Jefferson Trust Grant; designed analytics + training to reduce risky/inefficient driving.

- **Collision prediction in sports (RFID + haptics)** → Prototype to warn athletes of imminent impact.

Additional collaboration examples include technology feasibility for sleep interventions in older adults with MCI  
([Alzheimer’s & Dementia abstract](https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/alz.038831)).

### Teaching & mentorship snapshot
At UVA I supported **Exploratory Text Analytics**, **Statistical Modeling**, and **Business Analysis** with annotated notebooks, “just-in-time” primers, debugging videos, and flexible office hours—approaches recognized by the peer-nominated **Robert T. Ferguson III Memorial Award**. I enjoy meeting students where they are and helping them build confidence in coding, inference, and communication.

### Funding & acknowledgments
- **Jefferson Trust Grant** (Mindful Driving, PI).  
- **INSF** support for early work on expectation modeling.  
- Related co-authored work in sociological meaning and emotion **acknowledged support from ARO W911NF1710509**.

### Now
I’m applying my methods to mortgage-backed securities analytics as an **Investment Officer at the Virginia Retirement System**, while continuing interdisciplinary research and mentoring.

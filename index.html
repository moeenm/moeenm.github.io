<p>
    Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>
    I’m <strong>Moeen Mostafavi, I work at the <strong>Virginia Retirement System (VRS)</strong> applying
    machine learning and large-scale data analysis to <strong>mortgage-backed securities</strong> and fixed-income research.
    My academic work sits at the intersection of <strong>NLP</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>, and <strong>computational social science</strong>.
    I earned my Ph.D. in <strong>Systems &amp; Information Engineering</strong> at the University of Virginia, where my dissertation
    on emotion understanding in messaging integrated transformer models with Affect Control Theory and led to a paper in
    <em>Sociological Methodology</em> (2024).
  </p>

  <p>
    Along the way, I’ve collaborated across <strong>sociology, economics, kinesiology, nursing, political science, data science,
    business, and engineering</strong> on projects ranging from telematics-based fleet safety (recognized by NAFA as a
    “Best Special Project in North America”) to <strong>RFID + haptics</strong> for collision prediction and technology-enabled
    sleep tracking in older adults with MCI.

<p>Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>My name is  Moeen, and I am a  PhD candidate at University of Virginia (UVA).  I led multiple interdisciplinary Machine learning and Data Science projects during my study at UVA. <br><br>

 I worked with collaborators from different departments including  political science, sociology , and civil engineering. A capstone project that I led to monitor UVA vehicles and train the drivers was awarded a Jefferson Trust grant and led to UVA being ranked one of the "Best Green Fleets in North America" by the National Association of Fleet Administrators.
My Thesis at UVA uses NLP tools to understand the emotional state of customers while communicating with Chatbots.</p>
 
Last December I started an internship  with VRS. I have been working on a couple of projects that use statistical methods to quantize the insights that are usually used to make trading decisions. </p>

Please feel free to contact me if you have any question in your mind.

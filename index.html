<div class="home">

<p>Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>My name is &lt;Moeen &gt;, and I am a &lt;PhD candidate&gt; at &lt;University of Virginia&gt;.  <br><br>

I maintain a list of my publications, research projects and implementations under the <a href="/research/">Research</a> tab, and a list of other non-research projects under the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab. You may also check out my <a href="">Github profile.</a><br><br>

To get a better insight on my life so far, you can have a look at my <a href="/cv">curriculum vitae</a>. I blog (although quite less frequently) and pin them down <a href="/blog">here</a>. Feel free to read a bit more <a href="/about">about me</a>.</p>
Please feel free to contact me if you have any question in your mind.

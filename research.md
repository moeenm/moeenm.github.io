I build **computational methods that serve social and organizational decision-making**. My work sits at the intersection of **NLP**, **machine learning**, and **computational social science**, with applied threads in communication, safety/health, and public policy. This page complements my [Projects](/projects/) by grouping publications and artifacts under the research lines they advance.

## Themes & Questions

- **Affective meaning in digital communication**  
  How do people signal and interpret emotions in text-based settings, and how can models respect sociocultural context?

- **Data-driven safety & health**  
  When do sensors + analytics (telematics, RFID, wearables) change behavior and reduce risk?

- **Computational policy analytics**  
  What signals (e.g., finance vs. polls) forecast political momentum, and how stable are those relationships?

- **Expectations in socio-economic systems**  
  How do modeling choices about expectations affect stability/identifiability in macro-style systems?

### 1) Affective Meaning & NLP for Messaging
- **Contextual Embeddings in Sociological Research: Expanding the Analysis of Sentiment and Social Dynamics.**  
  *Sociological Methodology*, 2024.  
  <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00811750241260729>

- **Adapting Online Messaging Based on Emotional State.**  
  *UMAP ’21*.  
  <https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3450613.3459661>

- **How emoji and word embedding helps to unveil emotional transitions during online messaging.**

  <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9447137>  
  Code: <https://github.com/moeenm/emojis_unveil_emotions>

**What this line is about.**  
I combine transformer representations with affect control theory to better measure **context-dependent emotion** in chat and short text. The goal is interpretable affective signals that are useful for support agents, conversational systems, and social inquiry.

  <https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/alz.038831>

**What this line is about.**  
From **RFID+haptics** for collision warnings to **telematics-guided eco-driving** and **sleep technology** feasibility, I study how analytics + design can **reduce risk** and support healthier behavior in the wild.

- **A Tale of Two Metrics: Polling and Financial Contributions as a Measure of Performance.**  
  *IEEE SysCon ’21*.  
  <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9483746>

**What this line is about.**  
Using time-segmented models (e.g., joinpoint regression), I examine how **fundraising and polling** co-evolve in U.S. primary campaigns and what those dynamics imply for forecasting and resource allocation.

  *International Conference on Business and Economics Research*, 2010.

- **A predictive multi-agent approach to model systems with linear rational expectations.**  
  *First Iranian Economic Conference*, 2011.

**What this line is about.**  
Early work on **expectation formation** and solution properties in macro-style systems; emphasis on stability, interpretability, and plausible micro-foundations.

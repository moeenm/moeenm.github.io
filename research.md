I build **computational methods that serve social and organizational decision-making**. My work sits at the intersection of **NLP**, **machine learning**, and **computational social science**, with applied threads in communication, safety/health, and public policy. This page complements my [Projects](/projects/) by grouping publications and artifacts under the research lines they advance.

## Themes & Questions

- **Affective meaning in digital communication**  
  How do people signal and interpret emotions in text-based settings, and how can models respect sociocultural context?

- **Data-driven safety & health**  
  When do sensors + analytics (telematics, RFID, wearables) change behavior and reduce risk?

- **Computational policy analytics**  
  What signals (e.g., finance vs. polls) forecast political momentum, and how stable are those relationships?

- **Expectations in socio-economic systems**  
  How do modeling choices about expectations affect stability/identifiability in macro-style systems?

**What this line is about.**  
I combine transformer representations with affect control theory to better measure **context-dependent emotion** in chat and short text. The goal is interpretable affective signals that are useful for support agents, conversational systems, and social inquiry.

**What this line is about.**  
From **RFID+haptics** for collision warnings to **telematics-guided eco-driving** and **sleep technology** feasibility, I study how analytics + design can **reduce risk** and support healthier behavior in the wild.

  </div>

**What this line is about.**  
Using time-segmented models (e.g., joinpoint regression), I examine how **fundraising and polling** co-evolve in U.S. primary campaigns and what those dynamics imply for forecasting and resource allocation.
